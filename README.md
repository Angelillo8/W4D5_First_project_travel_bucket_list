Travel Bucket List

Build an app to track someone's travel adventures. 

MVP:

The app should allow the user to track countries and cities they want to visit and those they have visited.
The user should be able to create and edit countries
Each country should have one or more cities to visit
The user should be able to create and delete entries for cities
The app should allow the user to mark destinations as visited or still to see
Possible Extensions:

Have separate pages for destinations visited and those still to visit
Add sights to the destination cities
Search for destination by continent, city or country
Any other ideas you might come up with


# App done using Python, Flask, HTML and CSS.
